The trip was kept so secret that some of Pences staff and White House staff were not told about the trip in advance. He received a classified intelligence briefing and then spoke on the phone with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi.Pence told Adil Abdul-Mahdi it was a great privilege to be able to travel to Iraq and send the gratitude of the American people to all of the American service members in the country.Pence then went and served a Thanksgiving lunch of turkey, dinner rolls, cranberries, and other Thanksgiving staples to about 150 soldiers along with the Second Lady.We need Congress to do their job, Pence said. The truth is, Congress should have finished their business on defense appropriations months ago. But you all know partisan politics and endless investigations have slowed things down in Washington, D.C. Vice President Mike Pence arrives at Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, Saturday, Nov. 23, 2019. Pence also traveled to Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan to meet with Iraqi Kurdistan President Nechirvan Barzani as part of a trip meant to shore up support among American allies in the region amid geopolitical turmoil.Pence said the Erbil trip was an opportunity on behalf of President Donald Trump to reiterate the strong bonds forged in the fires of war between the people of the United States and the Kurdish people across this region.Trumps unexpected partial withdrawal of American forces from Syria in October threatened the support of American-allied Kurdish forces, drawing condemnation from Kurdish groups and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. More:Pentagon: President Trumps order to withdraw troops from Syria allows ISIS to rebuild Pences visit to Iraq also comes after testimonies related to the vice president in the impeachment inquiry of Trump.Jennifer Williams, a Pence foreign policy adviser, told lawmakers that Trumps July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky struck her as unusual and inappropriate.It was the first time I had heard internally the president reference particular investigations that previously I had only heard about through Mr. Giulianis press interviews and press reporting, she said in her Nov. 19 public testimony.

Keith Kellogg, national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, issued a statement the day of Williams testimony saying he also listened in to the July 25 phone call and heard nothing wrong or improper on the call, contradicting Williams.More:Trump dismisses Mike Pence aide Jennifer Williams, who overheard Zelensky call, as Never Trumper Trump mentioned investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden on the call in the same breath as security assistance to Ukraine. The conversation triggered the filing of an anonymous whistleblower complaint that later kicked off the impeachment inquiry. In other testimony, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland said Pence had been informed of the campaign to pressure Ukraine into opening politically motivated investigations.In his Nov. 20 public testimony, Sondland said he told Pence that it seemed security assistance to Ukraine was being held up until the statements get made. Pence nodded in response, Sondland said.Pences office has denied that the conversation ever happened.The Vice President never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations, Pences Chief of Staff Marc Short said in a statement.'
data_set['science']='Science is valued by society because the application of scientific knowledge helps to satisfy many basic human needs and improve living standards. Finding a cure for cancer and a clean form of energy are just two topical examples. Similarly, science is often justified to the public as driving economic growth, which is seen as a return-on-investment for public funding. During the past few decades, however, another goal of science has emerged: to find a way to rationally use natural resources to guarantee their continuity and the continuity of humanity itself; an endeavour that is currently referred to as “sustainability”.Scientists often justify their work using these and similar arguments—currently linked to personal health and longer life expectancies, technological advancement, economic profits, and/or sustainability—in order to secure funding and gain social acceptance. They point out that most of the tools, technologies and medicines we use today are products or by-products of research, from pens to rockets and from aspirin to organ transplantation. This progressive application of scientific knowledge is captured in Isaac Asimov’s book, Chronology of science and discovery, which beautifully describes how science has shaped the world, from the discovery of fire until the 20th century.However, there is another application of science that has been largely ignored, but that has enormous potential to address the challenges facing humanity in the present day education. It is time to seriously consider how science and research can contribute to education at all levels of society; not just to engage more people in research and teach them about scientific knowledge, but crucially to provide them with a basic understanding of how science has shaped the world and human civilisation. Education could become the most important application of science in the next decades.“It is time to seriously consider how science and research can contribute to education at all levels of society…”More and better education of citizens would also enable informed debate and decision-making about the fair and sustainable application of new technologies, which would help to address problems such as social inequality and the misuse of scientific discoveries. For example, an individual might perceive an increase in welfare and life expectancy as a positive goal and would not consider the current problems of inequality relating to food supply and health resources.However, taking the view that science education should address how we apply scientific knowledge to improve the human condition raises the question of whether science research should be entirely at the service of human needs, or whether scientists should retain the freedom to pursue knowledge for its own sake—albeit with a view to eventual application. This question has been hotly debated since the publication of British physicist John D. Bernal’s book, The Social Function of Science, in 1939. Bernal argued that science should contribute to satisfy the material needs of ordinary human life and that it should be centrally controlled by the state to maximise its utility—he was heavily influenced by Marxist thought. The zoologist John R. Baker criticised this “Bernalistic” view, defending a “liberal” conception of science according to which “the advancement of knowledge by scientific research has a value as an end in itself”. This approach has been called the “free-science” approach'
